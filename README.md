# Cafesys
Cafesys is the Django application driving the website of Sektionscaf√© Baljan. It features staff management and the
fantastic *Blipp* system for coffee.

## Setting up a development environment using heroku local
If you are using windows as OS start by downloading WSL.

Start by ensuring that all necesary requirements are satisfied by navigating to the project directory and running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the heroku client:
WSL/Linux: 
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | bash
or
sudo snap install --classic heroku
macOS:
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku

login to heroku through the termnial by running:
heroku login

Create a backup of the postgressql database by running:
heroku pg:backups:capture --app baljan

Download a dump of the database to the current directory:
heroku pg:backups:download --app baljan

Enable postgressql:
sudo systemctl enable postgresql 

Start postgressql command-line tool, and run the following lines. The parameters myuser, mypassword and baljan_local can be changed to any arbitrary string but make sure to remember them if changed:
sudo -u postgres psql

CREATE DATABASE baljan_local;

CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';

ALTER ROLE myuser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE myuser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE myuser SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE baljan_local TO myuser;

Exit the command-line tool for postgressql:
\q

Populate the newly created database, baljan_local in this case, with the dump file containing the database. Your dumpfile might have another name:
pg_restore --verbose --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U myuser -d baljan_local latest.dump

If you changed the parameters myuser, mypassword or baljan_local, then go to the .env file in the project directory and change the following lines to match your parameters:
DJANGO_DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/baljan_local

The setup is now complete, each time you wish to start the environment run the following:
for WSL2/Linux:
sudo service redis-server start
sudo service postgresql start
heroku local

for macOS:
brew services start redis
brew services start postgresql
heroku local



## Setting up a development environment in Docker
Install node.js
```sh
    npm install
```
This assumes you already have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
```sh
cp .env.docker.tmpl .env.docker
docker-compose up
```

The first time, run in another shell session:
```sh
docker-compose run --rm cafesys-django ./manage.py migrate
docker-compose run --rm cafesys-django ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput
docker-compose run --rm cafesys-django ./manage.py createsuperuser
docker-compose run --rm cafesys-django ./manage.py shell
```

In the Python shell, run
```python
from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
Site.objects.create()
```

When making changes to the code, you might need to rebuild the environment:
```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm cafesys-django django-admin.py collectstatic --noinput
```

This environment will use the `.env.docker` file for environment variables, **not** `.env`.

## Setting up a local development environment
### macOS
**Note: This guide requires that you have installed Docker and Docker Compose (see https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).**

This assumes you already have Homebrew installed and have basic knowledge on Python and its virtual environments.

Install system dependencies:
```sh
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install python3 postgresql glpk
```
*FIXME:* the list of Homebrew packages is probably incomplete.

Create a virtualenv with a Python 3 interpreter and activate it:
```sh
# Install virtualenv if not already installed
pip install virtualenv

# Setup and activate virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the needed Python dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the `postgres` and `redis` services with Docker:
```sh
cp .env.docker.tmpl .env.docker
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

The first time, run in another shell session:
```sh
cp .env.tmpl .env
./manage.py migrate
```

Start the Django development server and Celery daemons. You will need to open at least three shell sessions.
Make sure to activate the virtualenv with `source .venv/bin/activate` in every new shell session.
```sh
./manage.py runserver
celery -A cafesys beat
celery -A cafesys worker

```

This environment will use the `.env` file for environment variables, **not** `.env.docker`.

### Ubuntu 16.04
**Note: This guide requires that you have installed Docker and Docker Compose (see https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).**

This might work for other versions of Ubuntu but has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

Start by installing all dependencies. This can be done in a terminal by running the following commands:
```sh
add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
apt-get update
apt-get install python3.6 python3.6-dev python3-pip libpq-dev build-essential libssl-dev g++ libffi-dev python3-dev pypy glpk-utils
pip3 install virtualenv
```

The following steps are quite similar to the installation procedure on MacOS but differs slightly. First we setup the virtual environment: run the following command in a terminal at the repository root:
```sh
virtualenv -p python3.6 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Next, you should be able to follow the MacOS guide from the step "Then install the needed Python dependencies:".

### Vagrant (mainly for development on Windows)
Start by downloading and installing Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/.

Open a terminal in the root of the git repository and run `vagrant up`. This process may take a while, but please be patient.

Now you have a virtual machine setup for the entire Baljan stack. This stack can be accessed using a wrapper
around `manage.py` named `vmanage.py`. This means that the normal commands has been replaced with the wrapped
version. As a consequence of the wrapper implementation, it introduces some delay before every command is executed.

Migrate the database by running manage.py locally:
```sh
python vmanage.py migrate
```

Start the server on the interface `0.0.0.0` by running:
```sh
python vmanage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Livereload

When doing work on the frontend it can be handy to see your changes in real-time. This can be achieved by using a tool called "Livereload". To activate this when developing, run this command instead of runserver (make sure to have sourced the virtualenv):

```sh
./manage.py livereload
```
