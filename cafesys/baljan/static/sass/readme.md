## ABOUT
I use SMACSS METHODOLOGY (read more - https://smacss.com/).

## Details:

 * Every of directories have _index.scss file (file-manifest), that accomulate different parts of SCSS-code.
 * Main file main.scss import each _index.scss.

## Naming convention

I use prefixes:
* l - (layout)
* m - (module)
* s - (state)
>This helps easily identify the purpose of these styles and separate them from Modules or States.
