# Installation
Cafesys is preferably installed in a cloud environment. We provide an
automatic installation procedure for installing cafesys on Google Cloud
Platform, but it should be possible to modify the installation scripts
to work on platforms such as AWS or even local servers as well.

## Usage
Install cafesys by executing the following in a terminal on your VM
instance in Google Cloud. Make sure that you are logged in as a user
with sudo rights.
